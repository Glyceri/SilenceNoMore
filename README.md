**Silence no More**
 
This plugin allows you to see chat and send whispers normally hidden during duties.

The repo can be found here: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Glyceri/SilenceNoMore/main/repo.json`

**How does this plogon work?**
If you send a whisper to someone, the server sends that whisper to the receivers client. The receiver then says they are busy and send an error back. This plogon simply allows you to ignore that whisper.

**Common misconceptions cleared up**
- If **you** are **in a dungeon** and someone sends **you** a whisper **you can** see it.
- If **you** are **in a dungeon** and **you send** a whisper to someone **outside** of a duty, **they can** see it.
- If **you** send a whisper to **someone in a dungeon** and **you** are also **in a dungeon** then yes, **both of you need the plugin** to actually see the whisper.
